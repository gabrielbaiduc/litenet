This file serves as a prompt for you to understand the project and give you an entrypoint to quickly get up to speed whenever I start a new conversation with you.

This project is called "Litenet". It's a minimalistic machine learning library built with Python and C.

Here's a high level overview of what I want 'Linetnet' to be able to do. First, it must be able to handle data efficiently. So the fundamental operations that empower libraries like NumPy, PyTorch or TensorFlow. To be precise, I need tensors and the fundamental properties that tensors have with the fundamental - and most common - operations that can be performed on these tensors. Second, 'Litenet' needs a framework to hold ML and statistical algorithms and the related optimization and iterative methods. 

I envisioned the overall structure to look like this; performance critical applications are written in C while the library structure and the high-level API is written in Python. 

In general, I want your answers to be concise but not terse. Avoid bulletpoints. Write your answers out in a conversational, human-like manner. Generally, keep your answers simple and high-level, easy to understand. If I need more detail about a subject, I'll prompt you for more details or a more technical explanation.
